# Simple Blockchain Simulation using Python

## Overview

This project is a simple blockchain simulation that demonstrates core blockchain concepts such as:

- Block structure with transactions
- Hashing using SHA-256
- Proof-of-Work mechanism
- Blockchain integrity validation
- Ability to simulate tampering and detection

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Setup and Execution

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/prathamesh493/Blockchain_Simulation.git
   cd Blockchain_Simulation

### Run the blockchain simulation:
    python blockchainsim.py
    

### Interactive Menu

Once the script runs, you can choose from the following options:

1: Add a new block (Enter transactions manually)

2: Print the entire blockchain

3: Validate the blockchain integrity

4: Tamper with a block (Modify block data and observe detection)

5: Exit the simulation
